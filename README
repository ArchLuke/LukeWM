LukeWM written by Luke Kong

Philosophy:
LukeWM has two modes, cursor mode and cursorless mode. Cursorless mode implements a structure similar to DWM's tiling manager; usage does not require any cursors/pointers. Cursor mode is similar to Windows. Usage in cursor mode does not require keyboards (except for typing). Cursor mode will be a basic reparenting window manager, where each window will be given a close button. Windows in cursor mode will be resizable/movable using the normal cursor. 

Usage:
Switch to Cursorless mode with alt+1. Switch to cursor mode with alt+2. Your current mode will be shown with a top bar. Use alt+shift+t to open a terminal(note that opening a terminal may take up to a few seconds). With the cursorless mode, alt+shift+c to destroy a window;alt+shift+a to switch a window to master(visit dwm's website to learn about the master/stack structure;alt+shift+f to switch a window to stack;alt+shift+s to switch your current input focus to the left;alt+shift+d to switch your input focus to the right. With cursor mode, use alt+button 1 to move;alt+button3 to resize; the close button to close. Use config.h to configure. 

Installation:
To run LukeWm, copy the xsession file LukeWm.desktop to the /usr/share/xsessions directory and add the LukeWm executable to anywhere covered by your PATH variable. LukeWm will now show as an option in your session manager when you reboot. You will need to re-compile the source code if you wish the changes in config.h to take effect. To re-compile, you will need the xlib, xft, and freetype libraries. Make sure they're both up-to-date with sudo apt install libx11-dev, sudo apt install libxft-dev, and sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev. Now run make build, make, and make install to update the binary file.
